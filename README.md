The more you code the more ~~configurations files you're forced to manage~~ tools you get to use. Currently I have a single computer and there is no real need to maintain my configuration files between computesr. 
Therefore, this repo does not get much love. However, I think it's a neat set of configurations and a neat way to solve the problem of managing your .config like files through [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

If you enjoy messing with config files for things like tmux, neovim, etc feel free to experiment with this form of management system.
